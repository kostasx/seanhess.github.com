Wizard War
----------

We won Startup Weekend SLC with this multiplayer iOS game. I wanted to create a mobile game that brought people together on a couch or around a table. Wizard War allows two players to face off in a wizard duel combining action, reflexes, and elements of rock-paper-scissors. I spent several months after the event getting it ready for release. It's moderately popular among young people.

It's [Open Source](https://github.com/seanhess/wizardwar#wizard-war), written in Objective-C, and leverages Firebase, Reactive Cocoa.

Available for free in the [App Store](http://appstore.com/wizardwar)

Players create spells by combining elements in specific patterns. These spells counter each other like Paper Rock Scissors.

In addition to the Multiplayer there are a series of Quests against increasingly difficult opponents.
