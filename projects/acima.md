Acima hired me to create critical parts of their financial platform in 2016, including systems that communicate with credit bureaus, and predict loan performance using machine learning.

In 2017, encouraged by the success of the work we had done, they hired us to move their entire loan platform to ecommerce. Over the course of only 4 months, we created a complete application process and payment option for ecommerce that allows customers to open a payment plan with Acima on any ecommerce website.

We continue to support the systems we created for them.
